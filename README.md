# Path Title Plugin

Fork from: https://github.com/hhariri/path-title

Sets the Window Caption of the Editor to the complete path of the file (replacing somewhat the Navigation Bar functionality).

Adds "WebStorm" back to Title-Window.

Motivation: I want to bring the window to foreground / focus with a hotkey which requires a constant substring in window-title.

## Build

run `./build.sh` to bootstrap a docker-container which builds the jar-file

## Install

Choose "Install from Disk" and choose `build/lib/path-title-0.2.jar`
